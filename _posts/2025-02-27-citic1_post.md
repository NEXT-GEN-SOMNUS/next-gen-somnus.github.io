The CITIC research center at the University of A Coruña has joined forces with the Galicia Supercomputing Center (CESGA) to maximize the potential of the NEXT-GEN-SOMNUS project, which aims to develop more efficient solutions for studying sleep disorders.

Coordinated by Eduardo Mosqueira Rey and Diego Álvarez Estévez under the 2023 Knowledge Generation Projects call, and funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the State Research Agency, and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), NEXT-GEN-SOMNUS focuses on improving the analysis of medical sleep records. This is achieved through next-generation machine learning algorithms based on attention mechanisms, expert human-in-the-loop collaboration, and the integration of quantum computing.
