Adriana Anido Alonso, a researcher at CITIC (Universidade da Coruña), participated in the IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence held from March 17 to 20 in Trondheim, Norway. Together with Diego Álvarez Estévez, she presented their work titled “Multi-task deep-learning for sleep event detection and stage classification.”

Their study focuses on developing an AI algorithm to automatically analyze polysomnography recordings. The presented algorithm detects critical sleep events, such as apneas and arousals, while simultaneously classifying sleep stages within a single integrated visualization.

Currently, these analyses are performed manually and are time-consuming. The team’s tool aims to accelerate diagnosis and support specialists in treating sleep disorders.
