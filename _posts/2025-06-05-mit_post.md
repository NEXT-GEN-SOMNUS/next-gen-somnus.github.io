In 2025, four students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will begin research stays at CITIC of the University of La Coruña (UDC). This initiative is a key part of CITIC's internationalization strategy and is supported by the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) Spain program.

On June 4, CITIC's director, Manuel G. Penedo, will welcome the students, who will then join strategic teams and work on state-of-the-art projects. Juan Carlos Santiago, an MIT student studying artificial intelligence and decision making, will join the LIDIA group, mentored by Eduardo Mosqueira Rey. He will work on the NEXT-GEN-SOMNUS project, which focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for analyzing medical sleep records. He will collaborate with Diego Álvarez Estévez, a Ramón y Cajal researcher at CITIC. 

The other three students, Ishanvi Kommula, Jaime Sebastián Punyed, and Jace López, will join the RNASA-IMEDIR group. They will explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to cybersecurity with a focus on network traffic monitoring and threat detection.
