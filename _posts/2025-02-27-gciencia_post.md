The Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC) at the University of A Coru√±a, in collaboration with the Galician Supercomputing Centre (CESGA), is leading the NEXT-GEN-SOMNUS project. This project aims to improve the diagnosis of sleep disorders by using artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.

The project's primary goal is to develop more efficient, explainable solutions for analysing sleep recordings. To achieve this, new generation automatic learning algorithms based on self-attention mechanisms will be used, integrating human expert knowledge into the learning process. They will also adapt a quantum time series prediction model developed by CESGA to classify sleep stages and detect relevant sleep events.

The project aims to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic methods, which are complex, costly and not very scalable, making it challenging to meet the increasing demand. Integrating AI techniques and quantum computing will accelerate diagnosis, reduce costs, and enhance clinical efficiency, thereby benefiting over four million individuals in Spain suffering from sleep disorders.
