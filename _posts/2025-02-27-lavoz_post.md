The CITIC research center at the University of A Coruña is dedicated to developing technological solutions that address real-world challenges. Currently, CITIC is leading the NEXT-GEN-SOMNUS project, which aims to enhance the diagnosis of sleep disorders through the integration of artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

In collaboration with CESGA, the project focuses on designing advanced machine learning algorithms incorporating attention mechanisms to analyze polysomnographic data with greater accuracy and efficiency, while ensuring the interpretability of the results. A key objective is to adapt quantum computational models for the classification of sleep stages and detection of clinically relevant sleep events.

The research employs both empirical sleep data and simulations on quantum hardware and emulators to validate the models. By overcoming the limitations of conventional diagnostic methods—which are often labor-intensive and costly—this initiative seeks to accelerate and improve diagnostic processes. Additionally, expert clinical knowledge is incorporated to enhance model precision and interpretability.
