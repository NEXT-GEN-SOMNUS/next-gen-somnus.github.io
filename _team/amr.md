Alejandro Mayorga Redondo completed his BSc in Computer Science and MSc in Quantum Information and Technologies in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Even before finishing his undergraduate degree, he developed an interest in quantum computing, which led him to focus his bachelor's thesis on the subject with Vicente Moret Bonillo as his mentor. He graduated with honors in his master’s thesis, as well as in several other subjects during the program. He is currently pursuing a PhD under the supervision of Eduardo Mosqueira Rey and Diego Álvarez Estévez, with a research focus on the application of quantum artificial intelligence to the detection of anomalous events in polysomnographic signals. In parallel, he works as a part-time lecturer at the University of A Coruña, a role he complements with his involvement in the Somnus research project, which is closely aligned with the main themes of his doctoral research.
