description: This study explores the performance of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVCs) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in comparison to classical models for machine learning tasks. We find that quantum models tend to outperform classical approaches as the problem complexity increases, as QNNs exhibit superior performance in higher-complexity tasks due to their increased quantum load. These findings highlight the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for complex classification problems and provide insights into model selection and optimization strategies.
